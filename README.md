This is the implementation of our bachelor's thesis *Gamification of Learning* on Chalmers University of Technology.

## From the abstract in the report:

The purpose of this report is to describe the process of creating a web based application which purpose is to increase the engagement that students feel for their schoolwork. Students in higher education sometimes lack the engagement for studying certains courses is not uncommon. This might lead to a decrease in the student's performance in school. This projectâ€™s purpose is to find a way of getting students to feel more engaged in their studies with aid of the concept gamification.

When the application had reached its final stage it was put through a usability test, to see how intuitively it was to interact with. The test results showed some flawed design which would make the process of evaluating the gamification aspects more difficult. To better understand how well the application enhanced the engagment in studies, a more generous time frame would be needed for evaluation. The best case scenario would be to track students using this application during their studies. Based on the test results, there are indications that gamification has potential within the learning field.
