      <p>Now it is time to perform the statistical experiment from the previous step iteratively until enough data has been gathered. The more samples gathered, the more accurate the information will be. When measuring attributes of the subject of the experiment one should be mindful of the fact that certain interval of errors of measurement will occur.</p>
      <p>Graphing can be done once enough data has been gathered. Let X be a random variable containing the distribution of the subject and x be one of the values of X. The sample distribution can then be graphed by:</p>
      <p>Y axis: frequency of X = x</p>
      <p>X axis: x</p>
      <p>Whether X is discrete or continuous, it is often necessary to group the data in intervals to make sure the data isnâ€™t too spread out, especially if the sample size is small in comparison to its variance. The most common groups are 10 integer intervals (e.g the group 1 contains all values from -5 to 5) and 1 integer intervals (e.g the group 1 contains -0.5 to 0.5).</p>

      In this experiment, we would begin with measuring the height of different people. Luckily, we already have a dataset of measured heights available to us.
      <a href="http://socr.ucla.edu/docs/resources/SOCR_Data/SOCR_Data_Dinov_020108_HeightsWeights.html">Link to dataset</a>
      If you take a look at the data-set, you can see that the dataset has a size of about 20 000 measures. With some educated guesses, we conclude that the height would probably range from about 140 to 240 cm. This means the variance is rather small in contrast to the sample size. Thus, we decide to group the values to 1 integer.
      Let us graph it by frequency on the y axis and by height on the x axis:
